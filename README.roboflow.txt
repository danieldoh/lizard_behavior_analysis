The dataset includes 1701 images.
Animals are annotated in COCO format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -22 and +22 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.1 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.3 percent of pixels
